    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - sortFunction: the `SortFunction` used to determine the animation offsets for each subview
    ///   - prepare: a closure that will be called with each subview of `this` parent view
    ///   - animation: a `Animation` that will be used to animate each subview
    ///   - exclude: an array of views that the animation should skip over
    ///   - recursiveDepth: an int describing how deep into the view hiearchy the subview search should go, defaults to 0
    ///   - completion: a closure that is called upon the final animation completing. A `Bool` is passed into the closure letting you know if the animation has completed. **Note:** If you stop animations on the whole animating view, then `false` will be passed into the completion closure. However, if the final animation is allowed to proceed then `true` will be the value passed into the completion closure.
